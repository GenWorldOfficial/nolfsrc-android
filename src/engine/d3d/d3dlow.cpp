//  MODULE:   LOW (.CPP)  -- d3d.ren 0x1000d9b0 .. 0x1001e140, "low"
//
//  PURPOSE:  Twelve functions handed over as tier A -- "no fingerprint of the
//            unknown compiler, so cl should reproduce them byte-for-byte".
//
//  READ THIS BEFORE SPENDING A BUILD CYCLE ON ANY OF THEM.
//
//  ============ THE HEADLINE: THE SCREEN THAT PRODUCED THIS LIST IS ============
//  ============ TOO SHALLOW, AND NONE OF THE TWELVE CAN REPRODUCE.  ============
//
//  The tier filter rejects a body on eleven literal byte strings. Three of
//  its tests are much narrower than the property they stand for, and every
//  row in this listing slips through one of the gaps:
//
//   1. "call arguments STORED into the outgoing area" is tested as the two
//      strings `89 04 24` and `c7 04 24` -- i.e. ONLY a store of %eax, and
//      ONLY to (%esp) with no displacement. The unknown compiler writes the
//      other outgoing slots too, and it uses whichever register is free:
//        1000ef7f  89 0c 24        mov %ecx,(%esp)          <- %ecx, missed
//        1001c495  89 14 24        mov %edx,(%esp)          <- %edx, missed
//        1001c48a  89 44 24 04     mov %eax,0x4(%esp)       <- disp, missed
//        1000ef86  c7 44 24 08 ..  movl $0,0x8(%esp)        <- disp, missed
//      d3dneutral.cpp's own scan already lists this as reject rule (h) and
//      states it correctly; the filter's byte version does not implement it.
//
//   2. "an argument arrived in a register" is tested ONLY on the body's first
//      two bytes. Nine of these twelve take `this` in %ecx and never load it,
//      but the %ecx read is the second or third instruction, so the test
//      never sees it. 0x10015e30 goes further and takes BOTH arguments in
//      %eax and %edx with no stack arguments at all -- a convention cl has no
//      spelling for.
//
//   3. Not tested at ALL: the entry `sub $N,%esp` that exists only to keep
//      %esp 16-byte aligned across a call, unwound as a mismatched
//      `add $M,%esp` just before the pushes. cl never emits it -- it has no
//      stack-alignment policy in 1998 -- and it is unspellable in C. Five of
//      the twelve open with one:
//        1000d9b0  sub $0xc,%esp ... add $0x8,%esp; push; push; call
//        100157e0  sub $0x8,%esp ... push; push; call; add $0x10,%esp
//        10019a24  sub $0xc,%esp ... add $0x8,%esp; push; push; call *%edx
//      The function has no locals in any of these cases; the space is pure
//      alignment. (The `add $-8,%esp` ENCODING of the same idea is on the
//      fingerprint list as "add-neg-esp"; the `sub` encoding is not, and the
//      unknown compiler picks `sub` whenever the constant is positive.)
//
//  Applying d3dneutral.cpp's shape rules (a)..(h), which are the correct
//  statement of the same idea, kills all twelve. Verdict per function is at
//  the head of each block below and every one of them is "will NOT reproduce".
//  My recommendation is to measure ONE of them -- 0x100157e0, the smallest
//  and the only one whose sole defect is the alignment pair -- to confirm the
//  above on the real cl, and skip the other eleven.
//
//  THIRTEENTH ROW, DELETED. The listing's 0x1001dc8e (18 bytes) is not a
//  function. It is the interior of 0x1001dc70 -- it lands in the middle of
//  `movl $0x10091df0,0x8(%esp)` (c7 44 24 08 f0 1d 09 10), four bytes past
//  that instruction's start, and 0x1001dc70 is framed AND dummy-slotted AND
//  mov-arg. Nothing is emitted for it here.
//
//  ============================ WHAT IS HERE ==============================
//
//  Every remaining body was read instruction by instruction and is DECODED,
//  not inferred: the operand of every load and store, the shape of every
//  call, and the real `ret` (four of the listed sizes include trailing
//  padding -- corrected sizes are stated per function). The decodes are
//  compiler-independent and become testable the day the compiler is found.
//  Where a name could not be earned from the bytes, the function and the
//  global are named after their address, which is what the harness maps.

//  NEAR, AND A TOOLCHAIN RESIDUAL (measured under icl 4.0). Every shipped
//  instruction is reproduced; ours has ONE extra: a spurious `83 c4 00`
//  (`add $0x0,%esp`) between the `sub $0x8,%esp` and the first push. icl 4.0
//  /Os emits that pre-push adjustment in every esp-framed function that
//  pushes call arguments (it is `add $0x8` in 0x10019a24, which matches),
//  and never drops it when it is zero; d3d.ren contains no `add $0x0,%esp`
//  anywhere. Tried: /O2 (/O1, /Ox, /G4-/G6, /Qsfalign-, /Qsfalign16, /Gs,
//  /Ob0, /Qip, /Oi-, /Qrcd) -- /O2 builds the call with stores, not pushes;
//  the rest keep the `add $0`. Callee declared C++, extern "C", variadic,
//  through a pointer: no change. Same residual as 0x1001ead0 (d3dr2b.cpp),
//  0x10050cc0 and 0x10050de0.
//
//  Also tried as the SDK's by-value
//  `LTMatrix LTMatrix::MakeInverseTransform() { LTMatrix mRet;
//  Mat_InverseTransformation(this, &mRet); return mRet; }` (it is exactly
//  that ABI: hidden return pointer, returned in %eax, ret $4), with and
//  without a constructor, and inside w3_10014580_os.cpp's TU between
//  0x10015770 and 0x100158c0 where the address puts it, with the callee
//  0x10014ab0 defined in the same TU: the `add $0x0,%esp` stays every time.
//
//  (Older cl-era note:) the ONLY thing cl got wrong was the alignment pair
//  `sub $0x8,%esp` before the two pushes, unwound by `add $0x10,%esp`.
//
//  WHAT PINS IT: `ret $0x4` with %ecx never loaded is __thiscall with one
//  argument. %ecx is pushed SECOND and the argument FIRST, so the callee's
//  parameter order is (arg, this) -- and 0x10014ab0 writes the transpose to
//  its first parameter and reads its second, so `this` is the source and the
//  argument is the destination. The answer is `mov %ebx,%eax`, i.e. the
//  argument, not `this`. The call site agrees: %ecx = &local(-0x300) and the
//  pushed pointer = &local(-0x2c0), two 0x40-byte objects 0x40 apart, and it
//  keeps using -0x300 afterwards.

//  BYTE-IDENTICAL under icl /Os. The one lever was statement order: the
//  +0x698 store (m_p04->m_n88) has to be written FIRST -- then icl loads
//  +0x88 ahead of the +0x690 store, as shipped. Written in member order it
//  schedules the literal-1 store first (18 bytes differ).
//
//  NOT A SHIM CASE, though it looks like one: 0x10019a20 holds a loose
//  `mov 0x4(%esp),%eax` four bytes ahead of this entry. It is dead -- %eax
//  is overwritten by the second instruction here and nothing calls or

//  with no arguments. Three adjacent members at +0x690, +0x694, +0x698 are
//  filled from this->m_p04, the literal 1, and this->m_p04->+0x88; then the

//  0x1001e140   208 bytes (size correct)   9 callers
//
//  WILL NOT REPRODUCE, and by the widest margin of the reproducible-looking
//  ones. The shipped body loads all sixteen arguments up front, holding five
//  in registers and SPILLING TEN into a 0x2c-byte local area, then stores
//  them out. cl emits sixteen independent `mov ARG,%eax; mov %eax,N(%ecx)`
//  pairs with no frame at all -- about 120 bytes against 208. The kinds are
//  right; the allocation is a different compiler.
//
//  WHAT PINS IT: `ret $0x40` with %ecx never loaded is __thiscall with
//  sixteen dword arguments, and the mapping is exactly argument i -> +4*(i-1)
//  for all sixteen (traced through every spill slot: arg7..arg16 go out via
//  0x28,0x24,0x20,0x1c,0x18,0x14,0x10,0x0c,0x08,0x04(%esp) in that order).
//
//  IT IS A 4x4 MATRIX Init. The caller at 0x100156e0 is the identity
//  constructor: it writes 0x3f800000 -- 1.0f -- into arguments 1, 6, 11 and
//  16 and zero into the other twelve, which is the diagonal of a row-major
//  4x4. Callers 0x1001f1d2/0x1001f249/0x1001f2d8/0x1001f397/0x1001f624/
//  0x1001f6a3 sit in the same neighbourhood as the transposes.
//
//  DECLARED uint32, NOT float, DELIBERATELY -- the same trap d3dmisc.cpp
//  documents for d3d_TransposeRotation. The shipped code moves all sixteen
//  values with integer `mov`s. Float parameters get `fld`/`fstp` out of cl
//  and that is a different function; the true source is certainly
//  `float m11..m44`, and this declaration preserves the machine-code KIND at
//  the cost of the declared type. Named after its address rather than
//  LTMatrix::Init because the class it belongs to is not established.
