// one-call wrapper in front of it that servermgr.h calls `net_Free` and that
// smgr.cpp:7452 identifies as the image's `operator delete`.  The four
// engine-allocated buffers go through dfree; the client data block goes
// through net_Free; and the record itself goes through `delete`, which is
// why its free lands on the wrapper too.
//
// The five cdecl calls between the message loop and the hash walk share ONE
// `add $0x14,%esp` in both images (0x10027457, 0x00464213), which is cl 8447
// batching consecutive fixed-prototype cleanups -- it says nothing about the
// prototypes and nothing about statement grouping.
//
// The hash walk frees each record back onto CServerMgr::m_Bank89C by hand
// -- `*(void**)pRec = pBank->m_pFreeList ; pBank->m_pFreeList = pRec`,
// expanded at 0x10027476 and 0x00464235 -- which is servermgr.h's inline
// sb_Free, already used this way across the file.  snd_FindSentState below
// is where those records come from.
//
// The advance is its own statement, as in console.cpp's cc_ShowUsedFiles:
// nested inside the GetData call, VC6's right-to-left ordering would hoist
// it and the shipped batching is lost.
// NOT COMPILED: a duplicate of smgr.cpp's sub_100273e9, which is the copy
// lithtech.exe links (both place at 0x004641a0; the shipped image has one).

//     beside sb_Allocate.  /O1 still emits the COMDAT, so 0x10028933 does not
//     move.
//   * the fill is `memset`, not a named engine routine.  structbank.cpp calls
//     0x1003e280 `lt_MemSet` and says it "returns its fill VALUE rather than

//     memset, /O1 has no /Oi so it stays a call, and /O2 does, which is why

// HOW THE FLAG WORD IS SPELLED.  It is a uint16 with a dword home -- both
// images store it 32 bits wide and read it back with `cmpw` / `test %bx,%bx`
// (0x1002925e, 0x004675e1), which smgr.cpp's sub_10027ad0 note
// records as what VC6 does with a uint16 local.  The masks are written
// POSITIVE: the shipped immediates are 0x0000fbfb, 0x0000fffd, 0x0000fffb,
// 0x0000ffdf, 0x0000ffbf and 0x0000fdff, and `nFlags &= ~0x0404` on a uint16
// would give 0xfffffbfb instead.  So the source has the sixteen-bit
// complements, not `~CF_`.
//
// The three-way clear at the top is ONE statement (`and` then `or`, one
// store, 0x10029236..0x10029240) where every other clear is its own.
//
// The header is two WriteBytes or one, with the SECOND call shared: the
// wide arm writes (low | 0x80) and falls into the common WriteByte with the
// high byte, the narrow arm jumps into the same call with the whole word.
// That is one shared tail, not two separate statements.
//
// Every member read is WRITTEN OUT at each use.  pObject->m_pSData is
// fetched four times, pObject->m_pSData->m_pSFXMessage three, and
// pObject->m_ObjectType six; the single load each straight-line region shows
// is VC6's CSE inside a block, and the re-read after every call is what says
// there is no local.
//
// The light radius is a comparison in the SOURCE, not a conversion artefact:
// `fcoms` against 0.0f (0x1004d208 / 0x004a14d8) with the `< 0` arm FALLING
// THROUGH to `push $0` and the `>= 0` arm jumping to __ftol, and the two
// WriteWord calls merged.  A plain `(uint16)fRadius` emits __ftol with no
// compare at all.
// NOT COMPILED: a duplicate of smgr.cpp's lithtech-shape sub_100291c7, the
// copy lithtech.exe links for 0x00467540 (the shipped image has one).  Kept
// in the text as the /O2 reference the banner above describes.
