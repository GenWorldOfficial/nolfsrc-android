// server.dll — the CRT-file ILTStream (reconstruction). Build /O1.
//
// The simplest of the engine's four ILTStream implementations: a FILE* and a
// sticky error flag, twelve bytes in all. The interface is the SDK's — the
// vtable at 0x1004e920 lands on iltstream.h's eleven virtuals in declaration
// order, and three of its slots (ReadString, WriteStream, WriteString) point
// at the same generic implementations every other stream in the image uses,
// which is what confirms the anchoring.
//
// The error flag is only ever set, never cleared: once a read runs short the
// stream stays failed, which is what makes the SDK's advice work — read
// everything without checking, then ask ErrorStatus once at the end. Reads
// that fail also zero the caller's buffer, exactly as the header promises,
// so a partly-read structure is all-zeroes rather than half-garbage.
//
// The class name and the file name are ours; every method name is the SDK's.
//
// The whole run 0x10035a8d-0x10035c27 is one translation unit's worth of
// contiguous code, which is what places this in a file of its own.

// between them, and VC6 hosts the merged block at the SECOND site no matter
// how the source is written. Probed and rejected, on both Read and Write:
// the second test inverted so the failure is the `if` body; `else if` on the
// second test with either polarity; the pair wrapped in a positive
// `if (m_pFile) { ... }` with one trailing `return LT_ERROR`; an empty first
// arm with the failure in the `else if` (which sinks the LT_OK block to the
// end instead); and `if (size == 0 || fread(...) == size) return LT_OK;`,

// translation unit, and their neighbour above (0x100241cc) shows why the
// address proximity is no evidence of a home either.
//
// Both are read straight off the bytes. AddRef is `incl 0x4(%ecx)` and
// nothing else, on the same word ServerMessage's constructor clears through
// `andl $0x0,0x4(%esi)` — which is what puts the count on this class rather
// than on the derived one. Release decrements and tests in one instruction
// (`decl` then `jne`), so the source is `--m_nRefCount == 0` in the
// condition, and the destroy is a TAIL JUMP through vtable slot 3
// (`jmp *0xc(%eax)`) rather than a call, because nothing follows it.
//
