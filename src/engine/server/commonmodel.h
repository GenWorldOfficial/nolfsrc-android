//  MODULE:   COMMONMODEL (.H)
//  PURPOSE:  The shared half of ILTModel — the animation-tracker accessors the
//            engine implements once for both client and server, at
//            0x1001cff6-0x1001e055. The server-specific overrides that
//            broadcast a change to the clients live separately, at
//            0x1002dc22+, and report themselves as "ServerModelLT::".
//
//            The class name is ours. Only "MyServerInterface" is attested by a
//            surviving literal; everything in this file reports itself as
//            "ILTModel::", the interface.
//
//            LTAnimTracker's layout comes from the public ltanimtracker.h and
//            needs no reconstruction: m_Link 0x00, m_StringKeyCallback 0x0c,
//            m_pUser1 0x10, m_CurKey 0x14, m_Flags 0x18, m_InterpolationMS
//            0x1a, m_TimeRef 0x1c (m_pModel 0x1c, m_Prev 0x20, m_Cur 0x28,
//            m_Percent 0x30, m_iWeightSet 0x34). Every offset the accessors
//            use lands on a named field, which is the confirmation that the
//            shipped header and the shipped code agree.

//
// IT HAS A USER-DECLARED, void-RETURNING ASSIGNMENT OPERATOR, and
// the shipped image says so at both optimisation levels:
//
//   * 0x10016723 (42 bytes) in server.dll and 0x004457e0 (55) in lithtech.exe
//     are the same function — a thiscall that copies twelve bytes and then
//     sixteen and ends `mov 0x18(%eax),%eax; ret $0x4`, leaving `this`
//     NOWHERE. A compiler-generated operator= returns `this`, so this one was
//     written by hand and returns void. stdlith spells assignments that way
//     elsewhere too (BaseGenListPos::operator= in genlist.h).
//   * server.dll's CMoArray<CModelXform,NoCache>::CopyArray2 (0x1001b6a3)
//     CALLS 0x10016723 from its element loop (0x1001b6fb, stride 0x1c), and
//     lithtech.exe's CUnknownD974::sub_100165e5 (0x4456f0), which is the same
//     copy inlined whole, CALLS 0x4457e0 (0x445794). Our raw-float spelling
//     gives both a `rep movsl` of seven dwords instead.
//   * 0x10016723 lies between sub_1001671c (0x1001671c) and CUnknownD9E4's
//     constructor (0x1001674d), i.e. inside this translation unit's range.
//     collection.cpp's CCollElem1CV was built as a stand-in for exactly this
//     address, and that class — a plain twelve-byte head plus a sixteen-byte
//     sub-object with an assignment operator of its own — reproduces BOTH
//     shipped bodies byte for byte today. This is that class, named.
//
// So the two halves are sub-objects, not raw arrays, and they differ: the head
// has no operator= of its own (the compiler's memberwise copy, which VC6
// renders as three `movsl` at /O1 and three dword move pairs at /O2 — see
// gp_SetRotation / gp_SetVector in genericprop.cpp, which match in both images
// doing exactly that to an LTVector), while the tail's four dwords are moved
// one at a time, which is an operator= of its own being expanded.
//
// That is precisely the shape of LTVector (no operator=) and LTRotation (an
// in-class operator= assigning m_Quat[0..3] and returning *this), and the
// `(LTVector*)` / `(LTRotation*)` casts in Model::CModelSub1D4::sub_1001bf0d
// say the real source used them -- for the OTHER 0x1c record, CChildNodeXform
// below, which is exactly that pair -- and for this one too (see the
// operator's own note).
//
// CModelXform DOES have an empty default constructor and an in-class copy
// constructor that assigns its two members. The earlier "no constructor"
// reading was wrong, and its matches were look-alike credits from modelnew's
// CAnimXformQ444:
//   * BaseNew<CModelXform> (0x1001b71a) keeps the placement-new loop, folded
//     to a `jne` onto the next instruction. Without a constructor ours
//     inlined it and CopyArray2/Insert2/Remove2/InternalNiceSetSize
//     (0x1001b6a3, 0x1001a2b4, 0x1001a371, 0x10019633) missed.
//   * GenGetNext/GenGetAt (0x10018124/0x10018148) CALL a copy (0x100195b8)
//     where an implicit copy constructor gives a `rep movsl`.
