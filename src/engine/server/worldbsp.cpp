// ---- what used to live here ---------------------------------------------- //
//
// The four array constructors, `wa138_FreeItems`, `CWorldArray138::SetSize`
// and `CWorldSub108::Clear` were all defined below this line. All four
// classes are `CMoArray<T, DefaultCache>` instantiations now (see the block
// at the head of worldbsp.h) and Clear is in the class, so every one of those
// bodies comes out of collection.h instead. What each of them was, and what
// the shipped bytes had already said about it, is kept here because the
// readings are still the evidence for the instantiations:
//
//   * THE FOUR CONSTRUCTORS (0x1000b15c, 0x1000b295, 0x1000b4db, 0x1000b591).
//     Written by hand they were NEAR, four times over — 34 bytes against 34
//     and the same fourteen instructions, the whole residual being where one
//     of Init's two argument pushes sits. The shipped build spends the zero
//     as `mov %ecx,%esi; xor %eax,%eax; push %eax; <vptr>; <0x4>; <0x8>;
//     <0xc>; push %eax; <0x10>; call`, putting one push before the vtable
//     store and the other between the third and fourth field stores; ours
//     materialised the zero first and emitted both pushes together ahead of
//     the vtable store. Nothing in the source moved it: the field order was
//     probed, the four stores were tried as an inline `Clear()` member, both
//     arguments were tried as the members that had just been zeroed, a local
//     zero was tried in place of the two literals, and all four held compiler
//     revisions (8168, 8447, 8804, 8966) emitted our schedule. A four-field
//     non-polymorphic base whose inline constructor zeroed them was probed
//     too and MOVED the residual — it fixes the push schedule outright but
//     drops the vtable store below the four field stores, where the shipped
//     store is first.
//
//     `CMoArray<T, C>::CMoArray() { Clear(); Init(); }` is the spelling that
//     gives it: collection.h's Clear writes +0x4, +0x8, +0xc, +0x10 after the
//     vptr, Init's two zero arguments are the pushes, and the template body
//     matches 0x1000af9a — the same 34 bytes as all twelve other
//     `CMoArray<T, DefaultCache>` constructors in server.dll. So the residual
//     was never a scheduler lottery; it was the wrong construct.
//
//   * `wa138_FreeItems` (0x1000d181, 52 bytes) is `BaseDelete<CWorldSimple>`
//     and `wa138_AllocItems` (0x1000d1b5, 61) is `BaseNew<CWorldSimple>` —
//     LDelete_Array and LNew_Array, which are FREE FUNCTION templates, which
//     is why neither took a `this` and why the resize had to null the fields
//     itself afterwards. The release's whole body sits inside a null test on
//     the storage, walks the count DOWN, hands the allocator the *parameter*
//     rather than the walk's cursor, and runs 0x1000a849 — ~CWorldSimple —
//     over every element stepping 0xc0 bytes: which is what identifies the
//     element type, and the allocation agrees by placement-constructing each
//     slot with 0x1000a7de.
//
//   * `CWorldArray138::SetSize` (0x1000c0e7, 112 bytes) is
//     `CMoArray<CWorldSimple, DefaultCache>::SetSize2`, already matched from
//     collection.cpp. By hand it was NEAR — 112 against 112, the same
//     forty-eight instructions, every differing byte a register field: the
//     shipped build puts nItems in %edi and the zero in %ebx and ours did the
//     opposite. The template allocates them the shipped way. The fourteen
//     bytes this resize is longer than its four-byte siblings (0x1000bf8d,
//     0x1000c470) are `_DeleteAndDestroyArray`'s, not a difference in source:
//     an element with a destructor keeps BaseDelete out of line.
//
//   * `CWorldSub108::Clear` (0x1000a817, 50 bytes) is now IN THE CLASS. The
//     note that used to stand here said the definition was parked at the foot
//     of the file so that VC6 could not expand it into the two constructors.
//     That is wrong about the mechanism: a plain out-of-class definition is
//     never a /Ob1 candidate at ANY position, so the position bought nothing
//     and cost lithtech.exe both constructors, where the shipped /O2 build
//     expands the twelve stores in line (0x00425c82..0x00425cc4). /O1
//     declines the same body at fifty bytes, which is why server.dll carries
//     the standalone and a `call` to it either way.
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------- //


// 0x1000aa81 — CWorldSimple's eight-byte header off the stream, one field at
// a time.
//
// THIS ONE IS NOT AN /O2-SHAPE ROW, and it must not be marked `inline`.
// lithtech.exe has no standalone copy of it at all: scanning both images for
// the sequence that can only be this body (`lea 0x3(reg),reg; push $0x1`)
// finds exactly one occurrence in each, 0x1000aa81 in server.dll — the
// standalone we match — and 0x00426024 in lithtech.exe, which is INSIDE
// another function. That function is 0x00425df0, the simple world's loader:
// it opens with `call 0x00425d70` (CWorldSimple::Reset), ends with
// `call 0x00426090` (CWorldSimple::ComputeRadius), and has this whole body
// expanded at 0x00426000..0x0042603c along with a second five-read run of
// its own. It belongs to this translation unit and is not reconstructed.
//
// So the /O2 client's expansion has a caller we do not have, and `inline`
// here would buy nothing and cost something: nothing in this file calls
// wb_ReadSimpleHeader, so VC6 would stop emitting the COMDAT altogether and
// server.dll's 0x1000aa81 would go with it. The row closes when 0x00425df0

//  0x1000a8bb / 454 bytes — CWorldSimple::Load.
//
//  One sub-world of a terrain off the stream.  The caller is region S of
//  w_LoadWorldModel above (0x1000914f), which is where the __thiscall and
//  the three arguments come from: the element in %ecx and no `add $0xc,%esp`
//  after the call.
//
//  THE ROW WAS FILED AS A COMMONMODEL FUNCTION AND IS NOT ONE.  What made it
//  look like one is the string it prints, "** Terrain %s's name is too long,
//  can't hold TerrainSections" (0x100519ec, pushed at 0x1000a8ea); what it
//  actually is is settled from both ends — it opens with a call to
//  0x1000a882 (CWorldSimple::Reset), closes with 0x1000aacc
//  (CWorldSimple::ComputeRadius), reads its header through 0x1000aa81
//  (wb_ReadSimpleHeader, this file's), and every offset it touches is this
//  class's: +0x04 the base's name, +0x48 the header, +0x50 the parts array,
//  +0x64 the tree root, +0x68 the node array, +0x7c the parent and +0xb0 the
//  centre.
//
//  WHAT IT READS, in order: the section's own name (built from the parent's
//  and this sub-world's index, NOT off the stream); a node count and that
//  many 0x18-byte tree nodes, each of which is a part index and two child
//  indices; the root node's index; a part count and that many part indices;
//  and then the sub-object at +0x80, the eight-byte header, the centre.
//
//  THE TWO FAILURE REGIMES.  The name and the node array's sizing return
//  LTFALSE with NO cleanup (both jump to the bare `xor eax,eax` at
//  0x1000aa45); everything after them runs Reset first (0x1000aa3e).  The
//  print is a one-argument call to a format string that carries a `%s`,
//  which is a period bug and is written the way it shipped.
//
//  THE WALKING POINTER.  %edi crosses the node body as one register: it is
//  the node when +0x16 is stored, then the destination of three consecutive
//  dword stores, advanced by four after each (0x1000a96b, 0x1000a99b).  A
//  subscripted store would index off the node; this is one pointer, so the
//  source carries one.
//
//  THE NODE LOOP GOES THROUGH A LOCAL COPY OF `this`.  Every `this` use
//  inside the node loop -- the node address and the two w_GetTreeNode
//  arguments -- is spelled through `pWorld`, a plain `CWorldSimple*` copy
//  of `this`.  Without it the node address at 0x1000a933 comes out
//  offset-first (`mov 0xc(%ebp),%edi ; add 0x6c(%esi),%edi`); shipped is
//  base-first, `mov 0x6c(%esi),%edi ; add 0xc(%ebp),%edi`.  The alias only
//  at the node address, or only at the inner call, does nothing; it has to
//  be every use in the loop.  (Same mechanism as wm_ResetGeometry in
//  worldmodels.cpp, in the other direction: which pointer symbol the loop's
//  uses go through decides the operand order of the strength-reduced add.)
//  Probed without effect earlier: m_pArray[i], operator[], Get(i),
//  GetArray()+i, i+GetArray(), byte-offset i*0x18, uint32* i*6, an
//  explicit stepped `off` local, a CWorldItem18* node local, a
//  CWorldArray68* local (+2 bytes), declaration order.
