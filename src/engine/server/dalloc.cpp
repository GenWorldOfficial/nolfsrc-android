// server.dll — the engine's allocator (reconstruction). Build /O1.
//
// Every engine allocation goes through here rather than through malloc
// directly, for three reasons visible in the code: the time spent inside the
// CRT is measured, the outstanding count and the lifetime totals are kept,
// and a failed allocation is retried once after asking every registered
// hook to give memory back. Only the second attempt is allowed to fail, and
// when it does the engine says so and stops.
//
// The scoped timer is the interesting part: it is a counter plus the address
// of the total to add into, constructed at the top of a block and destroyed
// at the bottom, so the measurement brackets exactly the call and nothing
// else. The second, post-flush malloc is deliberately outside it.
//
// The file name is ours.
