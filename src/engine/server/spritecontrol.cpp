//     `fstp %st(0)` on each early exit). Two complete assignment statements
//     leave nothing live, so the next read goes back to memory.
//   * `m_bKill = 1` is written twice in the source and tail-merged by the
//     compiler — the timer-expired arm jumps forward into the copy the
//     object-gone arm hosts, which is where VC6 puts the survivor.
//   * the flag word is read once and tested three times off the same
//     register, then read from memory again after GetObject, because the
//     call could have changed it. That is what writing the member at each
//     use gives; a local would have been spilled across the call.
//   * GETHANDLE and LOOP are two tests, not one `& 0x14`: lithtech.exe
//     keeps `flags & 0x10` in edi (0x483931) and reuses it for the

//     twice — once per arm — with the vector copy itself cross-jumped. The

//      leaves the caller's pointer holding the last record examined before
//      the grow overwrites it.
//    * the "any" path falls out of the loop into the grow, and the hit
//      leaves the loop by a jump into the shared tail; the real-id path
//      reaches the same tail from its own success test. That is one label,
//      not two copies of the tail.
//    * the grow loop for a real id is a rotated `while`: the range test is
//      duplicated, once as the entry guard (`jb`) and once as the back edge
//      (`jae`).
//    * `*ppRec` is re-read from memory at every use in the tail — four
//      times, including once per client — rather than cached in a local.
//    * `&pClient->m_pObjInfos[index]` IS a named local: both stores fold the
//      index back into their own addressing and the shipped code is left
//      with a dead `lea (%esi,%ecx,4),%ecx` at the bottom of the loop, which
//      is the pointer-local fingerprint.
//    * the client list's head is a NAMED LOCAL, not the bound written out
//      inline. Both spellings walk the same list, but `&pMgr->m_ClientList
//      .m_Head` written in the loop condition lets VC6 destroy the manager's
//      register in place (`add $0x7e8,%esi`) while `LTLink* pHead =
//      &pMgr->m_ClientList.m_Head;` makes it compute the address into a
//      fresh register with `lea`, which is what the shipped code does and
//      which then re-binds every register in the loop body. Same size, and
//      it was the last seven bytes.
//    * the error site is RETURN_ERROR(1, "sm_AllocateID", 1) with the name
//      as a literal (`push $imm32`, not `push [imm32]`), and the code really
//      is 1: the shipped `.data` carries "1", not "LT_ERROR".
//
//  The name "sm_AllocateID" is the shipped check literal, so it is the

//  Two more strays from the same unreconstructed neighbour, parked here for

//  own block, and neither is sensitive to which translation unit compiles
//  it.
//
//  Both are slots of ONE vtable, at 0x1004e8c8 — twelve entries, installed
//  by a `mov $0x1004e8c8,...` at 0x10031fc0. Reading the table off .rdata
//  is what gives the slot numbers: 0x1003524a, 0x10035260, 0x10035269,
//  0x100352d5, 0x100352f5, 0x1003530b, 0x10035541, 0x100352b4, 0x10035568,
//  0x100355db, 0x100355df, 0x100355ec — so 0x10035541 is slot 6 and
//  0x10035568 is slot 8. (Slot 9, 0x100355db, is a four-byte body
//  /OPT:ICF has folded together with LThread::IsValid, which is why
//  lthread.h already claims that address.)
//
//  The class is the object mover the world simulation drives: slot 5
//  (0x1003530b) walks an object's attachments and re-places each child
//  through wm_MoveObject, and it reaches the server manager at `this+4`.
//  Only the two slots below are implemented here, so the view is abstract
//  and no vtable of ours is emitted (names ours).
// *********************************************************************** //

// The request record both slots are handed. Only two fields are reached:
// a priority-ish dword at +0x0c (slot 6) and the object being moved at
// +0x08 (slot 8). Slot 5 reads +0x00 and +0x04 as well, so this is the
// front of a larger record — commonphysics.h's forward-declared
