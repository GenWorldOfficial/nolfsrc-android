// This file deliberately does NOT include servermgr.h, and that is a debt
// rather than a design. It was dropped because servermgr.h declared
// un390_Term as void where the shipped body returns zero, and a return type
// is not overloadable, so the conflict could not be worked around locally.
// That prototype is now corrected, which unblocks the re-fold -- but the
// re-fold is more than restoring the include: StructBank, the sb_* trio and
// CUnknown390 are all declared below AND in servermgr.h, and the copy below
// carries the better layout (three StructBanks at 0x14/0x30/0x4c, the eleven
// per-type banks at 0x68 with stride 0x24, their pointer table at 0x1f4, and
// eleven LTLists at 0x220 -- all read off un390_Init).
//
// Doing it properly means promoting that layout into servermgr.h, which
// every server TU includes, and re-verifying all of them. Left as one
// deliberate piece of work instead of half-done here, because two live
// definitions of one class is exactly the divergence that let a wrong float
// constant sit in netmgr.cpp for months.

// file was not its to edit. Those three and this file's two belong together.

//     has a link whose prev/next are whatever the bank's memory held.
//
// Two things about the links are source, not codegen, and the function is
