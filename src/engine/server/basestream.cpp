// NEAR (183 bytes against 186, and the same seventy-nine instructions): the
// only difference is where the shared `xor %eax,%eax; jmp` that returns LT_OK
// is hosted. Two source statements return LT_OK — the empty-string arm and
// the maxBytes == 0 drain — and three edges reach the block. The shipped
// build puts it at the *first* of them, right after `pStr[0] = 0`, and jumps
// backward into it from the other two; ours puts it after the drain loop and
// jumps forward. That costs the shipped build three bytes, because from there
// the jump to the epilogue is 142 bytes away and needs the five-byte `e9`
// encoding where ours reaches it with a two-byte `eb`. The documented
// shared-exit-host class.
//
// Probed to a negative: the two LT_OK returns written as early returns and as
// an if/else-if/else chain with one return at the end, and the file rebuilt
// at cl 8168, 8966 and 8804. All four give the same 183 bytes.
//
// 0x10011314 — the read half of the same wire format: a word of length, then
// that many bytes, and a terminator the caller's buffer gets but the wire
// never carries.
//
// The interesting part is what happens when the string does not fit. The
// buffer is filled to maxBytes-1 and terminated, and the rest of the string
// is then read a byte at a time into a one-byte local and thrown away — the
// stream has to end up positioned after the string either way, or everything
// read afterwards is garbage. The same byte-at-a-time drain is what a caller
// asking for maxBytes == 0 gets for the whole string.
//
// The length is a `uint16` local and the shipped code reads it back as a word
// everywhere, but its two updates are 32-bit operations on the four-byte
// slot: `sub` without the 0x66 prefix is a byte shorter, and the high half is
// never read. The decrement is the same trick again — 0xffff materialised
// once into a register and added twice (11 bytes) rather than an imm32 add at
// each site (14).
//
// `maxBytes - 1` has to be a named local, not written out at its three uses.
// Written inline it comes out 188 bytes: VC6 keeps maxBytes itself in the
// register and folds the -1 into each use separately — a `-0x1(...)` in the
// terminator's addressing mode, and `1 - maxBytes` computed with a
// push/pop/sub for the remaining-length subtraction. One local gets the
// shipped single `lea -0x1(%eax),%edi` and the register reused three times.
//
// Nothing here reports a short read: the result of the length read is
// discarded, and only the result of the body read is returned. A truncated
// or absent string therefore comes back LT_OK with an empty buffer, and the
// caller is expected to ask ErrorStatus at the end instead.

// 0x10011402 — pump one stream into another through a 512-byte stack buffer.
// The frame is exactly 0x204 on server.dll: the buffer plus the four bytes
// VC6 spills `this` into; /O1 homes both the GetLen target and the running
// remainder in the dead dwMin parameter slot. lithtech.exe (0x00433920) keeps
// them apart — the length in a 4-byte stack local, the remainder in edi —
// which is what says they are two variables, the length one scoped to the
// default-end block (at function scope /O1 put it in dwMax's slot instead).
// The clamp is a ternary: an if-clamp makes /O1 hoist the 0x200 into a
// register and /O2 test the other way round. Byte-identical on both images.
//
// Both defaults are WRITESTREAM_DEFAULT (0xffffffff): an unspecified start is
// zero and an unspecified end is the source's whole length.
//
// SHIPPED BUG: dwMin never reaches the source stream. It is subtracted from
// the end to size the transfer and nothing else — there is no SeekTo call in
// the function at all (the only slots it indexes are 0x1c GetLen, 0x08 Read,
// 0x24 Write and 0x10 ErrorStatus). So asking for a range starting anywhere
// but the current position copies the right *number* of bytes from the wrong
// place, and every caller in the image passes the default.
