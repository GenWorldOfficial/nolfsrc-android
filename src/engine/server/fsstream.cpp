//
// Two of the engine's four streams live here, and both read out of a FILE*
// that they do not own alone: a resource tree is one file with many members
// in it, so a stream over a member is an offset, a length, and a share of the
// handle. The tree pointer at +0x10 is what decides who closes it: a stream
// over a file in a plain directory (tree kind 1) opened the handle itself and
// closes it, and a stream over a .rez member never does.
//
// Neither can be written to: Write is a three-byte "no", which is what makes
// them read-only in practice while still satisfying the interface.
//
// Both vtables (0x1004d280 and 0x1004d2ac) land on iltstream.h's eleven
// virtuals in declaration order, and both share ReadString, WriteStream and
// WriteString with every other stream in the image — the same three generic
// implementations, which is what confirms the anchoring.
//
// Class and file names are ours; the method names are the SDK's.

//
// The layout comes off the two Allocates (0x100075f1 for the tree streams,
// 0x100077d7 for the memory ones): both take the lock at this+0x20, pass
// this+4 to sb_Allocate, and store their own vtable into the record on the
// way out. The first word is the vptr — the bank is one of the same
// vptr-over-StructBank objects as CMessageBank and CNetBank.
//
// The banks are polymorphic, and the vtable at 0x1004d260 is the base's: its
// three slots past the destructor are all _purecall (0x1003ea24 is
// `push $0x19; call _amsg_exit`, and 25 is _RT_PUREVIRT), so the base declares
// a virtual destructor and three pure virtuals and nothing else. The
// destructor has to be *defined*, empty, or the derived destructor calls it
// instead of inlining the vtable-pointer store that ends both bank destructors
// (name ours).
//
// The three pure virtuals are an allocate, a free and Init, in that slot
// order, and they are not decoration either. The shipped /O2 client's two
// bank vtables (0x004a1ee8 and 0x004a1ef8) read
//
//     [ ??_G, AllocVoid, FreeVoid, Init ]
//     0x421a20 0x4218c0 0x4219c0 0x4219f0
//     0x421a60 0x421940 0x4219c0 0x4219f0
//
// and NOTHING in that image's .text calls any of those six addresses: every
// call site has the body expanded (Allocate into fs_OpenStreamInTree, Free
// into the two Releases). The standalone bodies exist only because the vtables
// take their addresses.
//
// The /O1 server says what the two slots really are. Its vtables (0x1004d250
// and 0x1004d270) read [ ??_G, 0x100075b5, 0x100075ba, Init ] and
// [ ??_G, 0x100075c6, 0x100075ba, Init ], and those three are FORWARDERS:
// `jmp 0x100075f1`, `push 4(esp) ; call 0x10007781 ; ret 4`, and
// `jmp 0x100077d7` -- while fs_OpenStreamInTree and the Releases call the
// workers 0x100075f1 / 0x100077d7 / 0x10007781 directly. So the virtuals are
// one-line wrappers over non-virtual inline workers, exactly stdlith's
// ObjectBank shape (object_bank.h: `virtual void* AllocVoid() {return
// Allocate();}` and `virtual void FreeVoid(void *ptr) {Free((T*)ptr);}`),
// whose names these take. /Os declines to expand the workers into the
// wrappers; /Ot expands them, which is the /O2 vtables' expanded slots.

// has to initialise it), then this class's own vtable pointer, then the body.
// The initializer chain around them is the compiler's: 0x10006d7e calls the
// expanded constructor and tails into 0x10006dd7, which registers 0x10006de3
// (`this` then a jump to the destructor) with atexit.
// Both are `inline`: the shipped initializers reach the global by its own
// address rather than through a `this` register and end without returning
// one, so the constructor bodies are expanded into them and no out-of-line
// copy exists.

// opened with fopen, and its length taken by seeking to the end and back. A
// .rez tree means the file is a member of an already-open archive, so the
// archive's name lookup answers with the member record and the length comes
// straight off it -- no file is opened at all, which is why the two kinds
// come out of two different banks.
//
// The fopen alone is wrapped in a timed scope; nothing else in the function
// is measured.

// The `push` of the filename is hoisted above the branch by the compiler

// 0x100074df — drain a stream into a named file on disk (name ours;
// serverengine.h declares it for fs_CopyFile, its only reconstructed caller).
//
// A stream that has already failed is not copied at all, and neither is a
// null one. The copy runs in 0x4000-byte blocks through one temporary
// allocation, and the block size is a *variable* rather than a literal: the
// shipped code puts 0x4000 in ebx once and uses the register both for the
// allocation and for the per-block clamp, where a literal would push and
// compare the immediate twice.
//
// The buffer comes from ::operator new (0x1000d25d, a one-argument forwarder
// in front of dalloc at 0x1000d2ef) and goes back through ::operator delete
// (0x10028ace): those are the two addresses the shipped calls reach. Calling
// dalloc directly compiles to the same bytes -- the displacement is masked --
// and names the wrong callee.
//
// Success is not the loop finishing but the offset having reached the length,
// which is what makes a stream that failed mid-copy report failure even
// though the file is left behind on disk with whatever arrived. The file and
// the buffer are released either way.
//
// The guards are NESTED POSITIVE tests with one `return 0` after them, and
// the allocation test is `if (!pBuf) fclose; else { copy }`. The lithtech
// twin (0x00421670) says so: all four failures land on ONE `pop; xor; ret`
// block there, where four early `return 0`s gave each its own copy, and the
// server build put the epilogue on the success path instead of the zero exit
// (whose old comment here blamed the compiler; it was the source shape).
// Byte-identical on both images.
