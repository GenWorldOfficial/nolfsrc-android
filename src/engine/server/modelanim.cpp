// server.dll — the animation tracker (reconstruction). Build /O1.
//
// A tracker is a cursor into a model's animation list: where it was, where
// it is, and how far between the two the vertices should be set up. The
// "where" is a pair of frame locators — animation index, keyframe index and
// a time in milliseconds — and everything here maintains that pair.
//
// Two flags matter. Bit 3 says the tracker is allowed to sit on an animation
// index the model does not have, which is how a tracker survives being set
// up before its model is loaded; every bounds check here is skipped when it
// is set. Bit 0 marks the tracker as carrying an animation at all, and bit 1
// is set by the initialization regardless.
//
// The interpolation counter doubles as its own "not interpolating" value:
// 0xffff means the previous locator is not a real place to blend from, which
// is what a fresh tracker and a hard animation change both leave behind.
//
// The file name is ours.

//    again (`movzwl 0x1a(%esi)`) after at_Reset has run, not from the sum
//    already in a register.
//  - the keyframe walk's bound is the last index, so its two tests are
//    `> nKeyFrames - 1` and `<= nKeyFrames - 1`, not `>=`/`<` against the
//    count; VC6 keeps the last index in a register and gets the count back
//    with an `inc` for the wrap test.
//  - the clamp compares against `nLength + 1` twice and VC6 commons it into
//    one `lea 0x1(%ecx),%edx`, so the `+ 1` is in the source expression.
//
// Three statement orderings had to be read out of the bytes, each worth the
// whole match:
//  - in the one-keyframe case the key is zeroed first, then the percentage,
//    then the time. With the percentage stored last VC6
//    cross-jumps this block's `fldz`/`fstps` into the blend percentage's
//    and the function comes out ten bytes short; with the percentage first
//    /O1 is identical but lithtech's /O2 copy (0x00401370) stores it before
//    m_CurKey where shipped has `mov %ebp,0x14(%esi)` first.
//  - the blend percentage is an if/else with the division first and the zero
//    second; reversing the arms puts the division out of line.
//  - the loop wrap takes the modulo first and zeroes the key after, and VC6
//    then hoists that store into the divide's shadow — which is exactly
//    where the shipped code has it. Zeroing the key first in the source
//    puts the store before the `xor %edx,%edx`, three bytes out.

// 0x10001490 — the next string keyframe at or after an index, on whichever
// animation the tracker's current locator names. Read off the bytes:
//
//   * the animation is reached the same way GetCurKeyFrame reaches it — the
//     current locator's index selects a 32-byte AnimInfo (`shl $5`) out of
//     the model's table and its first field is the ModelAnim — and an
//     animation slot that is empty is the same answer as finding nothing.
//   * the keyframe count goes into a local before the loop. It has to: the
//     count is volatile (see commonmodel.h on ModelAnim), and the shipped
//     loop compares against a register (`cmp %esi,%ecx`) rather than
//     against memory, which only a copy produces.
//   * and the counter is initialised in a statement of its own, ABOVE that
//     copy, rather than in the `for` initialiser. That is the whole of the
//     last two bytes: written as `for (i = iStart; i < nKeys; i++)` the two
//     loads come out count-then-argument, and written as `i = iStart;`
//     followed by `nKeys = ...;` they come out argument-then-count, which is
//     the shipped order. Two adjacent loads, and their order is the order of
//     the two source statements that produce them.
//   * the walk itself is written indexed — the shipped `add $0x14,%edx` is
//     the strength reduction, and the found path re-reads m_pKeyFrames and
//     recomputes the address, which is what an indexed source gives.
//   * type 0 is the string key (the same encoding at_DoKeyFrame reads), and
//     both the "no animation" and the "ran off the end" answers share one
//     `xor %eax,%eax` exit, so they are one trailing `return LTNULL`.
//
// Name ours; nothing in the image names it.
