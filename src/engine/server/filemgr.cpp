// 0x10007203 — one entry out of one directory inside one tree: a find-first
// and a find-next in the same function, told apart by whether the caller's
// state already holds a cursor.
//
// A directory tree is walked with the CRT's own find, over "<dir>\<sub>\*.*",
// and every name beginning with a dot is skipped -- which drops "." and ".."
// and any dot-file with them. The entry type is the find attribute's
// directory bit, inverted: `~attrib >> 4 & 1`, so 1 is a file and 0 is a
// directory, and the 1 that the `& 1` needs in a register is the same 1 the
// function returns.
//
// A .rez tree is walked through the archive's own tree instead, and the three
// cursors advance in order: the items of the current type, then the next type
// (whose first item is taken), and only when the types run out the
// sub-directories. A rez item's name has no extension, so the name handed back
// is the item's name, a dot, and the type.
//
// Running out frees the walk record and clears the cursor either way, so the
// caller can walk the same state again. The archive path frees it through the
// state rather than through the local, which is the same pointer.
//
// Shape, and what each part of it was measured to control:
//
//   * The whole body sits under a positive `if (pRec)`, the kind test is an
//     if/else and the function ends in one `return 0`. That, together with
//     the loop below, puts the shared `xor %eax,%eax` and the epilogue
//     straight after the on-disk exhaustion (0x100072b8), ahead of the found
//     block, as shipped; the old early-refusal shape with the `goto` loop
//     left them at the end of the function. (Whether the exhaustion then
//     says `return 0` itself or breaks out to the bottom one makes no
//     difference on either image.)
//   * The cursor is read inside each arm: lithtech.exe loads it separately
//     after the kind test (0x004212fb, 0x004213f7).
//   * The on-disk walk is the same find idiom as ar_FindFile: first/next
//     seeds nRes on the two arms of an if/else and the loop tests it at the
//     top, exhaustion first, then the dot test around the found block. /O1
//     gives `je` into the cleanup, `jne` to the found block and a `jmp` back
//     to the lone _findnext (0x1000728b-0x10007296); /O2 rotates it with the
//     _findnext duplicated at the bottom (0x0042136d), as shipped.
//   * The rez tail is `if (item) {...} else { if (!sub) return 0; ... }` with
//     one `return 1` after it: the item block then keeps its own `movl $1`
//     and jumps to the sub-directory block's `push $1; pop %eax`
//     (0x10007405 -> 0x100074d7).
//   * Both tails assign the time FIRST. /O1 still stores it last, but loads
//     it before the other stores, as shipped (0x100073e7, 0x100074c4);
//     written last, the loads come after the constant stores.
//
// NEAR on server.dll: 730 of 732 bytes, 211 instructions against 212, and
// the whole residual is one instruction. In the sub-directory tail the
// shipped build spends six bytes on `add $0x12c,%esi` (0x100074a1) so the
// re-read of pWalk->m_pSubDir after the strncpy is a two-byte `mov
// (%esi),%eax`; ours re-reads at the displacement. A `CRezDir**` local at
// block and at function scope, and a `CRezDir*&`, all copy-propagate back to
// the displacement form.
//
// The rez exhaustion is written out TWICE -- once where the types run out
// and the first sub-directory is fetched, once where the next sub-directory
// is -- rather than one copy reached by a goto. lithtech.exe says so: each
// fetch has its own test and store (0x004215c5, 0x00421607) and the second
// exhaustion is `push cursor; jmp` into the first one's dfree (0x0042161c),
// the cross-jump VC6 makes of two identical tails. server.dll merges the two
// either way. NEAR on lithtech.exe (916 bytes, 929 here, same block layout):
// what remains is allocation -- shipped keeps pState in ebp from before the
// kind test (ours: ebx in the disk arm), and holds zero in esi across the rez
// tail, which is where the 13 bytes go (`mov %esi,mem` for the three zero
// stores against `movl $0`). A one-case switch on the kind, an early
// `if (!pRec) return 0`, the disk exhaustion returning directly, and the rez
// exhaustions jumping to the final `return 0` were each measured and worse
// or no change.

// joined path, and directories are skipped rather than answered -- a name that
// resolves to a folder keeps stepping until a file turns up or the walk runs
// out, which is why this is a find and not a stat. A .rez tree asks its
// archive for the item and reads the two words straight off it.
//
// Byte-identical on both images. The walk is the ordinary find idiom: one
// result variable, seeded from _findfirst and refreshed from _findnext, is
// the loop's condition, and the handle is kept apart from it for the close.
// VC6 rotates that `while` into an entry test and a bottom test, which is the
// shipped `je` at 0x10007009 and `jne` at 0x10007026 (lithtech.exe
// 0x00420da7 / 0x00420dc1), with the attribute test alone at the top of the
// loop and the not-found close falling out of the bottom. Every shape that
// tested the handle and _findnext's answer as two separate `== -1`s instead
// (two gotos, do/while, for(;;) with break, goto loops, a bFound flag) came
// out with one of the two branches cross-jumped onto the other as a `jmp` on
// server.dll, and with the attribute test duplicated at the bottom of a
// rotated loop on lithtech.exe (291-296 of 300 bytes).
//
// The find handle is closed even when the find never opened
// (`_findclose(-1)`), because the close sits past the loop rather than
// inside a guard. The time is copied four bytes at a time through memcpy
// rather than assigned, where the archive side is a plain assignment -- the
// find data's field is a `time_t` and the record's is not. Written with a
// `return` on each path, as here, server.dll's /O1 build merges the two
// closes itself and carries the answer in ebx (0x10007028, 0x10007071), and
