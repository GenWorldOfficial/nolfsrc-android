// A byte-wide view of the file record's flag word, for the one operation VC6
// will not narrow on its own.
//
// The field is sixteen bits: se_LoadFile, which creates the record, stores
// its nFlags there as a word (0x1002bf0b `mov %ax,0xc(%esi)`) and reads it
// back as one (0x1002bf58 `mov 0xc(%esi),%cx`), and declaring it `uint8`
// costs both of those. But the shipped clear of bit 0 is `andb $0xfe`
// (0x1002b4cb) where a `uint16` field gives us `andw $0xfffe`, so the
// operation was narrowed and ours is not.
//
// The narrowing is not uniform in our build either, which is what makes this
// worth writing down: `|= 1` on the same `uint16` field DOES come out as
// `orb $0x1` and matches the shipped bytes at 0x1002b699 (sm_UnloadModel)
// and 0x1002b84f without any help. VC6 narrows an OR with a small positive
// immediate and declines to narrow the AND whose immediate has an all-ones
// high byte — even though both are equally safe. So this is an
// immediate-width difference, not a claim that the record has a byte there;
// a byte-typed view at the clear site is simply the only spelling found that
// reproduces it, and it is what took se_RegisterModel from 193 bytes to
// byte-identical.

// 0x1001cb33 — a request the reader can be handed straight away: no stream,
// no context, no child name, the do-nothing callback, and all four flags set.
//
// The store order is the shipped order and is not the declaration order: the
// child name goes first, then the stream, then the CALLBACK POINTER, then the
// context, then the four flags. Both constants live in one register — `xor
// ecx,ecx` serves the three zero stores and the `push $1` hoisted to the top
// of the function is popped back into the same register for the four ones.
//
// THE THIRD AND FOURTH STORES LOOK SWAPPED AT /O1 AND ARE NOT, and only
// lithtech.exe can tell you so. At /O1 the two constants share one register,
// so the three zero stores HAVE to be emitted together before the `pop %ecx`
// turns that register into the ones — which puts +0x08 third and the
// immediate store to +0x04 last (0x1001cb33), whatever the source said. At
// /O2 the caller already holds zero in %ebx and one in %edi, nothing is
// grouped, and the source order survives: se_LoadModelData's expansion of
// this constructor at 0x0046aadf stores $se_NoChildModel to +0x04 BEFORE the
// zero to +0x08. That one transposition was the whole of the 583-byte
// function's difference.
//
// AND IT IS `inline`, which is what se_LoadModelData below needs. lithtech.exe
// (/O2) does NOT have a standalone copy of this constructor anywhere — the
// eight stores appear in line at 0x0046aac0, where `xor %ebx,%ebx` and
// `mov $1,%edi` hold the two constants and then serve the rest of that
// function (`cmp %ebx,%eax` for its null tests, `push %edi` for its ones).
// server.dll (/O1, /Os) calls it out of line at BOTH its sites — 0x1002b238
// inside se_LoadModelData and 0x1001c615 in another translation unit — and
// should carry on doing so, because the expansion GROWS the caller (581 bytes
// against our 561), which is the one thing /Os refuses. Defined above its
// caller because VC6's inliner is forward-only.
// (The body now lives in serverengine.h, above every caller; see there.)


// The bank every dependency link comes out of, and the lock that guards the
// lists. Two separate globals, and the addresses prove it: the bank object is
// at 0x100585d8 with its own critical section embedded at +0x20 (0x100585f8),
// and the list lock is the standalone twenty-four-byte one at 0x100585c0
// immediately before it. 0x10013fab is the bank's global initialiser — vptr,
// the embedded lock's constructor, then sb_Init2(&m_Bank, 0xc, 0x20, 0x20),
// which is where the record size comes from.
//
// THE SHAPE IS FORWARDER-OVER-WORKER, and the two images together are what
// say so. server.dll's vftable for this class (0x1004d7d8) does NOT point at
// the allocate and free bodies; it points at two thunks that do nothing but
// forward to them:
//
//     0x1001409c   jmp 0x100140d3                       (slot 1, 5 bytes)
//     0x100140a1   push 0x4(%esp); call 0x10014107;     (slot 2, 12 bytes)
//                  ret $4
//
// while lithtech.exe's vftable for the same class (0x004a2438) points STRAIGHT
// at a 101-byte and a 38-byte body — the thunks with their targets expanded
// into them. So the class overrides its base's slots with tiny forwarders and
// keeps the typed allocate/free as ordinary members, which is also what the
// call sites want: dl_MakeLink and dl_UnlinkAndFree reach the typed pair
// directly (0x10014053, 0x10014045) and at /O2 expand it (0x0043c500 is
// dl_MakeLink with the whole of Allocate in line, 0x0043c4b0 the same for
// Free), which is only possible if the typed pair is an inline candidate —
// i.e. declared IN-CLASS, as below. /Os declines both expansions at 52 and 38
// bytes, which is why server.dll still calls them, and that is the shipped
// proof that writing them in-class cannot cost server.dll anything.
//
// The forwarders are defined OUT of the class on purpose: that is the one
// construct /Ob1 never expands, so both bodies
// are emitted in both builds whether or not this translation unit ever emits
// a vftable to hold their addresses. In lithtech.exe the typed pair has no
// out-of-line body at all — every call site expands it — and it is the
// forwarders that carry the 101 and 38 bytes at 0x0043c5c0 and 0x0043c630.

// The base whose three slots after the destructor this bank fills in. It is
// servermgr.h's CBankBase — same vftable, 0x1004d260, with _purecall in all
// three slots — but that declaration spells the two middle slots `void _v04()`
// and `void _v08()`, and the thunks above prove this bank's are `void*` with
// no argument and `void` with one. An override has to match exactly, so the
// shared declaration cannot serve here without changing servermgr.h and every
// other bank that derives from it. Declared locally with the right signatures
// until that is in scope; the vftable addresses are relocations either way, so
// the emitted bytes are the same class of thing.

//    and with the new-expression VC6 lets the null result share esi with
//    pModel's LTNULL — which fixed the whole three-way register rotation.
//  * the directory comes from CHelpers::ExtractNames, not _splitpath (see
//    the declaration below): the buffer is the SECOND argument.
//  * the cleanup record is `new CModelCleanupRec(mgr, model)` with an
//    inline constructor — the manager load before the model store at
//    0x1002b1a3 is the constructor's argument evaluation.
//  * guards, not nested ifs. lithtech.exe keeps every error block in line
//    where its guard is, and says so: the missing-file block straight after
//    the se_LoadFile test (0x0046a86b) and again after the stream test
//    (0x0046a933), the SetFilename and se_RegisterModel failures sharing one
//    delete-and-LT_ERROR copy (0x0046a9d8), and the dResult failure its own
//    copy at the very end (0x0046aa41) — which is what makes that last one
//    the `if (!dResult) {...}` body's fall-out rather than a guard.
//
// The residual is the same on both images and it is one thing: where VC6
// hosts a tail it merges. Shipped keeps the merged copy at the FIRST site
// and has the later one jump back (server: the `xor %eax,%eax` at the hash
// hit 0x1002b06e, reached from the success tail; the missing-file block at
// 0x1002b095, reached from the stream test; lithtech: the stream copy's
// `jl 0x46a89f` into the se_LoadFile copy's epilogue). Ours always keeps the
// LATER copy. Measured negatives: a backward `goto` into the first
// missing-file copy (VC6 moves the block to the stream test anyway, 568 and
// five blocks), `goto` into the hash hit's `return LT_OK` (no change), the
// hash hit made the textually last `return` by inverting the test (the xor
// is then hosted there but the whole hit block moves to the end: 577, three
// blocks), and `return dResult` for the success tail (no change).
//
// One child model, named by its parent's file. The name in the file is bare,
// so it is resolved against the parent's own directory — which is why a model
// and its children have to live together.
//
// From there it is the same as loading any model, and it recurses: a child
// with children of its own comes back through here. What is different is the
// end, where the model is given a callback that takes it out of the manager's
// hash again when it goes, so that nothing is left pointing at it.

// src/engine/lithtech/csvis.cpp already reconstructs it as
// cs_InheritFileFromServer, named for the one string it raises, "Client
// inherited model %s from server!", and that file's own note lists 0x0046add3
// as one of its two call sites. So the shipped serverengine.cpp really does
// call into the client when a client is present, under some preprocessor
// guard, and server.dll is simply the build where that guard is false.
//
// THE MACRO'S REAL NAME IS NOT KNOWN. build/engine.sh now defines
// LT_SERVER_BUILD for the server target only, purely as a named
// discriminator for cases like this one -- do NOT overload
// LT_SERVER_TIMERS, which means something narrower (the scoped
// CountAdder the client genuinely lacks). The original symbol
// build/engine.sh defines for server.dll and not for lithtech.exe (worldsim.cpp
// and four other files already turn on server-only code with it), so its
// negation is used here as the stand-in for "a client is in this process".
// If a properly named discriminator is ever added to build/engine.sh, this is
// the site to move onto it.
//
// The symbol below cannot be linked against csvis.cpp's (the mangling differs
// and the argument class is spelled there, not here), the byte comparison masks every
// relocated byte and the whole link joins the two through link/aliases.rsp,
// so the declaration only has to give the right calling
// convention and argument count.

// 0x1002b41b — a model that has finished loading joins the manager's hash
// under its own filename, and every object that was waiting for it is
// switched over.
//
// The wait works like this: se_InitModel points an object whose model is
// still loading at the manager's placeholder and marks the object's tracker
// with bit 3, and marks the file record with bit 0. So the flag on the file
// is what says "somebody is waiting", and the objects to fix are the ones
// whose engine-side data names this same file. Each one gives the placeholder
// its reference back, takes one on the real model, and loses the marker bit;
// then the file loses its own.
//
// The filename is asked of the model three times rather than kept in a local,
// which is what the three GetFilename calls in the shipped code are.
//
// What comes back is whether the hash insert *failed* — nonzero on failure —
// which is why se_LoadChildModel treats a zero as success.
//
// This was written up as an irreducible callee-saved rotation (ebx and edi
// swapped, 191 of 191) and it was neither. Two source facts were missing and
// they were one fault: the bit-0 clear had to go through the byte-wide view
// declared at the top of this file, and the list head had to be a named local
// assigned *before* the first link is read. With the flag clear one byte too
// long the register pressure was different, so the head-first spelling — which
// had been probed and rejected on its own — did nothing; with the flag fixed
// it puts the manager in edi and the head in a fresh ebx exactly as shipped.
// A rotation is a symptom, and probing one lever at a time can hide the
// second.
